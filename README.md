📊 Brightness Employee Termination Data Analysis – Case Study
🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the employee termination records of Brightness Ltd., a fictional retail organization.
The goal was to understand termination patterns, employee retention trends, and forecast the potential number of future terminations using Excel-based analytics.

Through this study, we aimed to answer key HR questions such as:

How many employees left in 2020?

What were the primary reasons behind terminations?

What proportion of exits were voluntary versus involuntary?

How can we estimate future terminations based on past trends?

🧾 Dataset Summary

The dataset contained employee-level information such as joining and termination dates, department, city, gender, and reasons for exit.
The main columns analyzed were:

Hire Date & Termination Date: To calculate the employee’s total years of service.

Department & Job Title: To study termination distribution across departments.

Termination Reason: Categorized as Resignation, Retirement, or Layoff.

Termination Type: Classified as Voluntary or Involuntary based on HR definitions.

Experience Status: Each employee was tagged as Newcomer, Proficient, or Expert depending on their years of service.

⚙️ Methodology

The analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel, where several logical and analytical operations were performed:

Data Cleaning and Preparation

Verified the correctness of date fields (hire and termination).

Removed blank or invalid termination entries.

Ensured consistent formatting of termination reasons.

Experience Classification

Each employee’s total years of service were calculated from their joining and termination dates.

Based on years worked, employees were grouped into:

Newcomer – less than 5 years

Proficient – 5 to 10 years

Expert – above 10 years

Termination Categorization

Termination reasons were analyzed and grouped into broader types:

Voluntary Terminations (Resignation or Retirement)

Involuntary Terminations (Layoffs)

This allowed for better insight into employee-initiated vs. company-initiated separations.

Trend Analysis (2020)

The dataset was filtered to identify employees who left in 2020.

A total of 1,485 employees were found to have been terminated in that year.

Forecasting 2021 Terminations

A 7% growth assumption was applied to project next year’s expected terminations.

Additionally, a what-if scenario table was built to evaluate termination counts at growth rates between 4% and 10%.

Termination Reason Analysis

Termination counts were summarized based on the reason for exit:

Layoff – 708

Retirement – 392

Resignation – 385

Layoffs represented the largest share of total terminations.

Voluntary vs. Involuntary Analysis

Out of 1,485 total terminations, 777 were voluntary (Resignation or Retirement).

Thus, 52.32% of the overall terminations were voluntary in nature.

📈 Key Findings

A total of 1,485 employees left the organization in 2020.

Layoffs formed the majority of separations (47.6%), followed by Retirement (26.4%) and Resignation (25.9%).

More than half of all exits (52.32%) were voluntary, indicating healthy career mobility but also possible retention issues.

Based on a 7% year-on-year growth projection, 2021 terminations were expected to reach approximately 1,589 employees.

The trend suggests the organization could face consistent turnover pressure unless proactive employee engagement and retention measures are implemented.

🧰 Tools & Techniques Used

Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

Pivot Tables and logical conditions for grouping and summarization.

What-If and Forecasting analysis to simulate termination growth under various conditions.

Visualization-ready dataset prepared for potential HR dashboard integration.

💡 Conclusion

The Brightness Employee Termination Analysis provided meaningful insights into workforce exits, highlighting both voluntary and involuntary separation trends.
The data-driven approach enabled HR to understand where turnover was concentrated and to anticipate future attrition levels.

This case study demonstrates how even simple spreadsheet-based analytics can offer powerful business intelligence when structured correctly.
